# Release Notes

## Compose

- New action added 'expansion step.
This is a new type of action "expansion" so now we have expansion by langs or steps. This new action gets a complex query and splits it by steps/topics into more and simpler queries and creates a new retrieve action step with this new one queries.

Action example:

```json
{
    "action": "expansion",
    "action_params":{
        "params": {
            "k_steps": 2,
            "model": "techhub-pool-us-gpt-3.5-turbo-16k"
        },
        "type": "steps"
    }
}
```
